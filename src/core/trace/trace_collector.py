"""Trace collector – receives finished TraceContext and persists them.

The collector is the bridge between in-memory TraceContext objects and
the on-disk JSON Lines log used by the Dashboard.  It is intentionally
decoupled from the logging module so that trace persistence remains
predictable and testable.
